ALGORITHM TECHNIQUES
##### Divide and Conquer Approach (An Algorithm Design Paradigm)
      An Algorithm that divides the problems in two/smaller parts 
      and then combined/added together to produce the problem's final solution
- Example: Merge Sort Code
def merge_sort(arr):
  if len(arr) < 2
    return arr
    
  else:
    mid = len(arr)//2
    left_part = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right_part = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return join_sorted(left_part, right_part)


##### Brute Force Search (Problem-Solving Technique, An Algorithm Paradigm )
      - Definition
      A brute force algorithm simply tries all possibities 
      until a satisfactory solution is found
      
      It is method of solving problem, In this method every possibility is examined, trying all possible answers and picking the best one.
      
      - Performance
      The time complexity of Brute Force is O(n*m) which is sometimes written as O(n*m)
      So, if we were to search for a string of n characters in a string of m characters using brute force, it would take us n * m tries.
      
- Example: Naive Algorithm to find a pair sums up to k (tries every possible layer)
def find_pair(arr, k):
  for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
      if (arr[i]+arr[j]) == k:
        return (i, j)
  return(-1, -1)



##### Randomized Algorithm
      A randomized algorithm uses a random number at least once 
      during the computation to make a decision

##### Dynamic Programming   
      - it loses Space but earns Time  (by Bellman)
      It solves complex problems by breaking'em into multiple simple subproblems
      and then it solves each of them once and then stores them for future use.
      DP is an optimization techniques for recursive solutions 
      that have overlapping subproblems, we use dp to solve a subproblem only sequence.
      The components of a dynamic programming algorithmic solution?

      - Implement the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm to solve DNA
      - Decompose large problems using Dynamic Programming techniques
      - Apply Dynamic Programming techniques in the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm

- Fibonacci Number Series
- Sequence Alignment
- Knapsack Problem
- Tower of Hanoi Puzzle
- Shortest Path by Dijkastra
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- A type of Balanced 0-1 Matrix
- CheckerBoard
- Egg Dropping Puzzle

- Example: nth term of Fibonacci Seuence
def fibonacci(n):
  dp = [0]*(n+1)
  dp[0] = 0
  dp[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, len(dp)):
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
  return dp[n]



##### Greedy Algorithms
      In this approach, decisions are taken 
      on the basis of the information currently available without worrying about the future
      The approach doesn't relook at the previous chosen solution.
      The method tries to find/chooses the best/most (optimal) solution/move at each step.
      The first step is chosen in such a way that it gives immediate benefit.
      This Approach/These Algorithms are mainly used for solving optimization problems
      The method doesn't guarantee/provide that we will be able to find a optimal solution in many problems.
      However, the method gives near optimal solution in a reasonable time 
      and it is efficient in many cases and easy to implement
      Hence, Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm which is based on inference
Components of Greedy Algorithms
- Candidate State: The solution is created by this set
- Selection Function: It's used to add the best candidate to the solution
- Feasibility Function: It's used to determine whether the candidate can be used to contribute to the solution.
- Objective Function: It's used to assign a value to a solution.
- Solution Function: It's used to indicate whether a complete solution has been obtained

Greedy Algorithms
- Huffman Coding (for a Huffman Tree)
- Fractional Knapsack Problem
- Activity Selection
- Job Sequencing Problem
- Travelling Salesman Problem
- Decision Tree
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (for Graph Search and Short Path Finding)
- Kruskal's Algorithm (to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Prim's Algorithm (to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree)

- Example: Activity Selection Problem (Maximum Number of Activities in finite amount of time)
def max_nb_activities(activities, time_limit):
  activities.sort()
  count = 0
  time = 0
  for activity in activities:
    if (time + activity) > time_limit:
      break
    else:
      count += 1
      time += activity
return count    


###### Recursive Programming 
      An Algorithm that calls itself repeatedly until the problem is solved. 
- Factorial
- Exponential
- Tower of Hanoi
- Tree Traversal
- DFS of Graph

- Example: To determine the sum of first n natural numbers
int fact(int n)
{
  if (n <= 1) //base case
    return 1;
  else
    return n * fact(n-1);
}


##### Backtracking Algorithm
      A backtracking algorithm solves a subproblem,
      and if it fails to solve the problem,
      it undoes the last step
      and starts again to find the solution to the problem.
      Another Definiton: 
      An algorithm that tries all the possible candidates
      and goes back as soon as it defects that the actual candidate can't be valid
      
- Example: Count subsets that sum up to k
def subsets_k(arr, k, i=0):
  if k == 0:
    return 1 #valid candidate
  elif k < 0 or i == len(arr):
    return 0 #unvalid candidate
  else:
    return subsets_k(arr[i], i+1) + subsets_k(arr, k, i+1)

Data Structures & Algorithms III: AVL and 2-4 Trees, Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Learn more complex tree data structures, AVL and (2-4) trees. Investigate the balancing techniques found in both tree types. Implement these techniques in AVL operations. Explore sorting algorithms with simple iterative sorts, followed by Divide and Conquer algorithms.

his Data Structures & Algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.

You will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. Both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are O(log n). AVL trees are a subgroup of BSTs and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from BSTs. Additionally, AVLs incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance. (2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues.

As you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide & Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.

Data Structures & Algorithms IV: Pattern Matching, Dijkstra’s, MST, and Dynamic Programming Algorithms

Delve into Pattern Matching algorithms from KMP to Rabin-Karp. Tackle essential algorithms that traverse the graph data structure like Dijkstra’s Shortest Path. Study algorithms that construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a graph. Explore Dynamic Programming algorithms. 

You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim’s and Kruskal’s.

Prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal’s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest.

The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs.
