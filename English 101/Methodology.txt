 --– Linguistic View (Language Theories)
      1. Traditional View
        - Focus on Written Language and its grammar are special attention (Kurallı Dil Önemli)
        - Grammatical structure must be correct (accuracy)
        - Prescriptive
        - Spoken language is seen erroneous
        - Language is not for communication, Language is a means of understanding literature/philosophy (GTM)


      2. Communicative/Functional View
        - focus on Language Functions instead of structure  (dilin yapılarına odaklanmak yerine işlevlerine odaklanılır)
        - Language as a tool to express functional meaning
        - Semantic and Communicative Aspect of language (Bir çok işlevi vardır bu işlevler öğretilmeli)
        - Communication (frequency)
        - Communicative Competence
        - Communicative approach
        - Appropriate and Effective use of language (yaş, cinsiyet, fiziksel ortam, yakınlık ilişkisi dilin kullanımı açısından önemlidir)
                

      3. Generative Transformational Theory View
          - Chomsky
          - Competence (Knowledge of the Language) (Zamanla kazandığımız tüm bilgi ve beceriler)
          - Performance (the actual use of the language) (Öğrendiklerimizi uygulaya dökmek)
          - Innatism: Inborn ability to acquire language rules and produce utterances   (Dil doğuştan gelir)
          - The focus is on the mental activity
          

       4. Structural Linguistic View
          - Ferdinand de Saussure
          - Language is for Communication   (Asıl amaç, sözlü iletişimdir)
          - Language analyzed as a formal system
          - Language containing structurally related components: grammatical, phonological, and lexical units. 
          - The focus is on Everyday Language (Descriptivism) (How the language should be/use) (toplum nasıl kullanıyorsa o şekilde öğrenciler kullanır)
          - Predescriptive (Everyday Language)


        5. Interactional View
          - Dil iletişimsel bir araçtır, iletişim odaklıdır ve öğrenciler de dili iletişim kurmak amacıyla kullanmalıdır
            

--- Theories of Learning (öğrenmeyle ilgili teoriler)
         BEHAVIOURISM
              - Against Cognitivizm
              - Stimulus – Response (Otomatikleşme) (Habit Formation) (AudioLangMethod)
              - Reinforcement vs Punishment
              - ***Reinforce - Increasing the probability of a behavior, reinforcing correct responses (Ödül)
              - ***Punishment – Decreasing the future frequency of sth unwanted (punishing wrong utterances)

              Positive (Presenting), Negative (Removing/Eliminating) 
              --> Reinforcement (+)
                    Increase the probability of a behavior by presenting a motivating stimulus
                    Eg: Praising learners, Rewarding learners, saying a student welldone.
              --> Reinforcement (-)
                    Increasing the probability of a behaviour by removing sth negative
                    Eg: Eliminating homework, Extending a deadline
              
              Positive Punishment, Negative Punishment
              --> Punishment (+)
                    Presenting a negative outcome to decrease probability of an unwanted behaviour
                    Eg: rebuking someone, making students clean the classroom at a boarding school
              --> Punishment (-) 
                    Taking away sth desirable. 
                    Eg: Cancelling break time, extending deadline for a Project, cancelling cinema time
                    Hataya izin yok yoksa fossilization olur
                  - Immediate correction (Hatalar tolerans gösterilmez, hemen düzeltilir)    
    
                  - Individuals Tabula Rasa
                  - Passive Learner
                  - Imitation the Environmental Stimuli (Uyarıcıyı taklit)

                  - Gözlemlenebilen davranışlara odaklanır
                  - Learning is Habit Information (öğrenmek davranış ile olur alışkanlık)
                  - Drills – Tekrarlanan şeyler
                  - Memorization (Ezberleme)


                    Habit Formation:
                        When learners imitate and repeat the language, 
                            they hear in their surrounding environment and are positively reinforced for doing, so Habit Formation Learning occurs.


        INNATISM (Chomsky, Krashen)
                Features
                    - Universal Grammar

                    - Mental capability
                    - Mental Representation

                    Human beings are born with mental structures 
                    that are designed specifically for the acquisition of language, and therefore they are biologically predisposed to learn language.
    

        INTERACTIONISM
                    - Interplay between Innate Ability and Environment
                    - Both Genetic and Environment factors
                    - Physical, Social and Cognitive factors

                    - Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
                        Yakınsal gelişim alanı, bir öğrencinin desteksiz olarak şu anda yapamadıkları ile desteksiz olarak yapabilecekleri arasındaki mesafedir.
                        Yalnızca daha fazla bilgi veya uzmanlığa sahip birinin desteğiyle yapabilecekleri aralıktır.
                    - Scaffolding (Novice and Expert to assist them)


        HUMANISM

                    - Making learners feel comfortable (Relaxing Environment)
                    - Self-Actualization (Goals, Motivation)
                    - Intrinsic motivation (Kendini motive etmek)

                    - Knowledge is constructed within Social Contexts
                    - Communication w each other (insanların birbiriyle iletişimi)
                    - Sharing knowledge, feelings and experiences
                    - Integration of learners into a Community (Interacting with Community)
                    - Building on previous knowledge and experience (Fikir Alışverişi - Yeniler eskilerin üstüne inşa edilir)
                    - Bilgi sosyal ortamda, yetişkin yardımıyla öğrenilir. Sosyal ortam göz ardı edilemez
                    - Collabrative Learning
                    

        COGNITIVIZM
                    (Piaget)
                    - Against Behaviourism -- Language Learning as a Mental Activity
                    - Cognitive Development (öğrenci kendi öğrenme sürecini yapılandırmalıdır)
                    - Schema, Schemata
                    - Maturation
                    - Nature
                    - Nurture

                    - Analyzing, Planning
                    - Cognitive Process (Bilişsel sürece katılan öğrenci)

                    - Internal and Mental processes of learning (Öğrenme içsel bir süreçtir, doğrudan göstermez)
                    - Relationship between language and cognition
            
                    - Organization of knowledge and new learning by a mental structure
                    - Reorganizing Existing Knowledge
                    - Individuals act, construct, plan and analyze their learning
                    - Importance of Negative and Positive feedback

                    - Deneme - Yanılma
                    - Denge --> Dengesizlik --> Tekrar Denge

        CONNECTIONISM
                    - Study of SLA (Second Language Acquisition)
                    - Association -- Language acquisition is a process of Associating Words with elements of external reality
                    - Language is a system of units that become intertwined in the mind
                    - Strictly against Innatism (Connectionism challenges Innate knowledge)
                    - Creating Networks that connects words and phrases
                    - Language includes Linguistic Units
                    - These units are connected in mind
                    - The more we see or hear, The more we connect them
                    - Repeated input or Linguistic stimuli (maruz kalmak)
                    - Var olan bilgilerle, yeni gelen bağlantı oluşturur


        INNATISM (Chomsky, Krashen)
                    - Critical Period Hypothesis
                            It claims there are biological mechanisms specifically designed for language acquisition 
                            and these cease to be available at or even before puberty. 
                            Thus, an older learner has to use general mechanisms that are not effective for language acquisition.
                    
                            - First Language Acquision 
                                > Stages
                                    - Cooing:               Motherese Language (Mum talks to child)
                                    - Babbling:             ba, ba, pa, pa
                                    - One-Word Stage:       milk, cat, cookie   (Holophrastic)
                                    - Two-Words Stage:      baby chair, mommy cat
                                    - Telegraphic Stage:    daddy go bye, cat drink milk
            
                    - Comprehensible Input Hypothesis (Krashen) - Study of SLA
                            1- Natural Order Hypothesis 
                                Simple to Complex – Predictable Order
                            2- Input Hypothesis
                                Input should be comprehensive
                                L+1 – One step above your current level
                            3- Monitor Hypothesis
                                Students need time to think, observe one’s output (check and correct)
                            4- Acquisition of Learning Hypothesis
                                Conscious      vs.     Unconscious
                                (learning sys.)        (acquired sys.)
                            5. Affective Filter Hypothesis
                                Emotional
                                When one learns sth, the other is uncomfy
                                (High Anxiety Level)
                                Teacher’s joke or familiar questions makes ss relax

                    - Interlanguage Hypothesis (Selinker)
                            - L1, L2 errors are neutral
                            - Language Learning is a process

                             ERRORS
                                - Interference** 
                                        thank you, nothing 
                                        Language transfer
                                        Interference error
                                        Türkçe düşünerek İngilizce
                                        I library went (why the native speaker of Turkish makes the exemplified grammatical error in english)

                                - Overgeneralization
                                        I goed, I walked, I eated
                                        (Grammatical Structure)

                                - Fossilization**
                                        Mistakes exist even though he knows the correct (Hatada kalıcı olmak)

                                - Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (Robert Lado-57)
                                        Errors from the interference from the first language
                                        Errors from the transfer from the first language

--- Methods and Approaches
               APPROACH: 
                        It is a set of assumption about language learning and teaching. 
                        Theories about the nature of language and language learning. 
                        Statements about how to promote language learning. 
                        It is source of principles and practices of language teaching (yaklaşım bilimsel değildir teori gibi işte). 
                        Approach: HOW LANGUAGE IS LEARNT? ---> SÖYLEM

                METHOD: 
                        It is a plan of presentation of language material   
                        UYGULANIŞ, the way of teaching language, it is application of principles and findings. 
                        It is based on an approach. --> Her metod bir yaklaşıma dayanır ve kaynağı olur.
                        It takes student and teacher roles, syllabus type, and techniques into account. 

                TECHNIQUE: 
                        Specific activities used during teaching process. 
                        It includes tasks, exercises, activities.

      # Approaches: Content-Based Approach, 


                GRAMMAR TRANSLATION METHOD
                        Classical Method / Prussian Method
                        - Literature (Language is utilized to read, understand and interpret literacy texts)
                        - Based on no specific approach
                        - Paragraph questions
                        - Individuals become sophisticated and intellectual

                        Learning Theory (Öğrenim nasıl yapılıyor) 
                        - L1 used translation
                        - Memorize vocabulary
                        - Deductive Grammar (deductive teaching is applied) – Tümden gelim
                        - Grammar rules are taught explicitly/deductive
                        - Rules are reinfored by exercises

                        - Teacher Authority
                        - Errors aren’t tolerated and instant correction
                        - Reading, Writing

                        Importance of Culture
                        - Target Culture is thought to be composed of literature and fine arts
                        - The culture is learnt through texts

                        The role of mother Tongue
                        - Classroom language is student’s mother tongue
                        - Instructions are given by using student’s mother tongue

                        The role of teacher
                        - Teacher is strict authority
                        - The class is teacher-centred
                        - students passive

                        Teaching Areas
                        - Grammar and Vocabulary are paid special attention
                        - Reading and writing are emphasized
                        - Speaking and Listening areas are neglected

                        Teaching Grammar
                        - Grammar rules are taught deductively 
                        - Deductive - kurallar açık şekilde verilir, öğrenciler exercices) != inductive - çıkarım yoluyla okutursun
                        - students memorize rules
                        - Rules are practice and antond through exercises
                        - Translation of literary texts

                        Teaching Vocabulary
                        - words are presented w their mother tongue equivalents
                        - synonym and antonym
                        - using cognates (trafik-traffic)

                        Interaction
                        - little interaction between teacher and students
                        - no interaction between students

                        Error Correction
                        - no tolerance of errors because of accuracy
                        - immediate error correction
                        - the focus is on accuracy rather fluency (akıcılıktan ziyade gramer doğruluğuna odaklı)

                        Syllabus type
                        - Structural syllabus is used in this method

                    - Communicative activities in CLT
                    1- Information gap activities (biri bilir diğerine öğretir iletişim önemli) bilgi alışverişi
                    2- choice: Öğrenci yeter ki kendin ifade etsin nasıl isterse öyle doğru yanlış
                    3- feedback: karşıt dönüt önemli

            TASK BASED LANGUAGE TEACHING APPROACH
                    - Real World, Everyday Discourse
                    - Activities outside of the classroom
                    - Making a phone call to reserve ticket or sending an e-mail (real life context)
                    - Creating school newspaper or magazine
                    - Meaningful purpose rather than using grammatical features
                    - Real World activities
                    - Authentic Context
                    - Problem Solving, Decision Making
                    
                    Görev verilir: istediğimiz sonuç değil, süreç
                    - task is the fundamental unit for teaching
                    - the tasks are based on real-life contexts
                    - The purpose is to make students use the target language communicatively
                    - language is a tool to perform a task
                    - students improve their strategies such as turn-taking(konuşma sırasını vermek), asking for clarification etc. (iletişimde işe yarayacak stratejiler)
                    - teacher is designer, selector and sequencer of the tasks
                    - task based syllabus is used
                    - the focus is on process

                    Students’ success is often measured in terms of their ability to do something with a language, 
                                        such as creating a school newspaper, rather than their accuracy
                    in using certain grammatical features.
                    
                    Task-Based Language Teaching Method
                    - öğrenciler problem çözer
                    - authentic material
                    - en etkili yöntemdir denilebilir
                    - öğrenci problemle karşılaşır, öğretmen bu problemi task olarak verir, öğrenci çözmeye çalışır
                    - genelde günlük hayatta karşılaşılan problemler seçilir (iş başvurusunda bulunmak gibi)

                    - öğrencinin görevini seç planlamasını yap
                    - öğrenciler taskleri yerine getirken işbirliği yapar bu önemlidir
                    - dili kullanmaya çalışırlar
                    - öğretmenin amacı dili günlük hayatta karşılaşabileceği sorunları çözüp, günlük hayatta kullanılabilen ifadeleri kullanmasını sağlamaktır
                    - öğrenci dile maruz bırakılır
                    - hedef dil kullanılır
                    - iletişim öğrenciler arasındadır v önplandadır

                    Tasklar nasıl olmalı
                    - Verilen taşkın bir amacı olmalı
                    - authentic olmalı
                    - belli bi süreci olmalı adım adım ilerlemeli
                    - öğrenci mutlaka problem çözmeli
                    - öğrenci bi ürün ortaya koymalı
                    - öğretmen feedback vermeli
                    - iletişim önplanda olmalı

                    1- Information gap: fikir alışverişi
                    2- Opinion gap: öğrenciye bir konu hakkında fikri sorulur ve sonrası fikri sunar
                    3- Reasoning gap: Öğrenci verilen bilgiden çıkarım yapar

            NEURO LINGUISTIC PROGRAMMING APPROACH
                    - Remove negative, give positive
                    - Communication is non-verbal (feelings and emotions aren’t things that you have, but things that you do.)
                    - NLP assumes all human action is possible

                    - based on the assumptions spread after a study

                    - NLP teaches people to develop self-awarenessi to change their thoughts and emotional behaviours

                    Components of NLP
                    - neuro – neurological processes/senses and neurological processes
                    - linguistic – language is the means of making sense of the world, conceptualizing things, experiencing, and influencing experiences 
                        (dili kullanma biçimi yaklaşım, dğnyayı algılayış)
                    - programming – to reach our aims, we can train ourselves in terms of thinking, speaking, acting


                    VAKOG System of NLP

                    In a nutshell (kısaca toparlarsak)
                    - Anxiety is eliminated
                    - L2 is used

            MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES APPROACH
                    Gardner
                    - each learner is unique
                    - different learning style, inteligence type
                    - to intelligence type to choose appropriate activities
                    - humanistic
                    - no preprepared syllabus

                    Techniques

                    - comparing and classifiying for logical
                    - mental images (gözde canlandır) – visual

                    -  collaboration and cooperation – interpersonal
                    - reflective writing - içe dönüklük ama olumlu anlamda - intra-personal
                    


            ECLECTIC APPROACH
                    - Conflicting opinions among theories
                    - Personalized teaching methods
                    - Different Learners with different need and abilities

                    - use of techniques and principles of different methods and approaches
                    - Unique educational contexts
                    - teacher make decisions about teaching process
                    (tüm yaklaşımlar/methotlar kullanabilir)

                    - öğretmen bir metoda bağlı kalmaz
                    - var olan metodların hepsinden işe yarar özellikleri alır kullanır. Yeni hibrit bi metod gibi
                    - bu metod öğrencinin ihtiyaçlarına, kültürüne ve seviyesine göre seçlir




            NATURAL APPROACH
                    - Krashen
                    - Comprehensible input hypothesis

                    Doğal yoldan öğrenme

                    Natural Method = Direct method
                    Natural approach is different
                    - similarity between L1 acquisition and L2 learning
                    - language as a means of communication
                    - Teaching communication skills
                    - Indispensability of the lexicon
                    (bebeğin yeni dil öğrenmesi gibi, input olarak lexicon yapıları alır)
                    - the focus is on vocabulary teaching rather than grammar
                    - a silent period
                    - authentic materials (ana dille ilgili şeyler orijinal materyal)
                    - discovering rules through comprehensible input (input ver kuralları keşfetsin)
                    - the importance of reading and listening input (asıl öğretmemiz gereken şey communication skill)
                    - The teacher provides comprehensible input, content and materials
                    - Interaction occurs between the teacher and students in the beginning. Then, between students.
                    - L2 is used

                    Techniques
                    - Q and A
                    - communication activities
                    - realias and pictures
                    - body language
                    - listening tasks


                    Dil öğrenmede iki kavram vardır
                    - acquision (unconscious)
                       ana dil öğrenmek gibi, bilinçsiz bir şekilde gerçekleşir. Doğrudan mahruz olmak
                    - learning (conscious)
                       bilinçli olarak yapılan öğrenmedir. Formal bir ortamda ders ortamı. Matematik gibi dersler bu şekilde öğretilir
                       dil öğreniminde acquisition daha başarılıdır ama

                    Krashen’a göre 5 tane hipotez var: öyle bir ortam olsun ki ana dil edinildiği gibi target dil edinilsin


                    1- The Acquision-Learning Hypothesis
                        Edinim ve öğrenme aynı şeyler değildir.
                        - Acquisition as unconscious process
                        - Learning as a conscious process (okul ortam olmalı)
                        - adults(both of them) vs children(only acquisition)

                    2- The monitör hypothesis
                        - öğrenme sürecini görüntülemek kontrol etmek
                        - learning monitoring as a controller
                        - it corrects the outcome
                        - acquisition is responsible for fluency (edinim akıcılık için önemli), sonradan öğrenme ise edinimle öğrenileni kontrol edebilme durumu. 
                            Öğrenme sonucu kafamızda şemalar oluşur. Ve konuşurken kafamızda hep kontrol ederiz bu yüzden akıcılık yavaşlar.


                    3- The Natural Order Hypothesis
                        - An order of acquiring grammar rules (doğal sırayı değiştiremezsin)
                        - some rules are learned before others!!
                        - this order doesnt change
                        - dilin öğretme ve öğrenme sıralaması konularla ing, plural s, possesivve s, past marker ed, third person singular s.

                    4- The Input Hypothesis
                        - Comprehensible input for acquisition (naturally)
                        - Comprehensible input slightly beyond their level (i + 1)
                        - Çocuğun anlamlandırabilecği çocuğun seviyesine uygun bilgilere Comprehensible input. Seviyesinin üzerindeyse o bilgiyi edinmeye çalışır


                    5- The Affective Filter Hypothesis
                        - affective filter is low (kendini iyi hissedersin lowda) when anxiety is low
                        - Acquisition occurs when affective filter is low
                        - motivation, self confidence, anxiety
                        - saygı seviyesi
                        - çocuklarda azdır.
                        - Amaç: çocukların kendilerini ifade edebilecek beceri geliştirmelerini sağlamak: 
                            fluency, çocuğun hemen konuşması beklenmez, comprehension(süreç anlama) > production (sonuç ürün) den daha önemli


            WHOLE LANGUAGE APPROACH
                - Holistic view
                - Language is a vehicle
                - Interactional Perspective

                Aim
                - to make students use L2 in real-life situations
                - to help them practice language in social contexts

                Tenets (inandıkları)
                - there is holistic approach to language (dile bütüncül yaklaşıyor, becerileri bölmüyor ayrı ayrı değil bir bütün şeklinde)
                - the language is taught as a whole rather than being divided into units (LSWR)
                - students dont learn passively
                - knowledge is not taken from the teacher
                - language is socially constructed
                - students learn through interactions
                - authentic materials and tasks are used
                - no artificial materials or tasks
                - students’ needs are taken into account while chossing material
                - learner-centered
                - the teacher is a facilitator, guide, active participanant
                - errors are tolerated
                - only major errors are corrected
                - culture is important and included in real life situations

                Techniques
                - Authentic reading (dil öğretimi için oluşturulmuş metinler değil)
                - reading literary texts
                - Individual or group reading activities
                - Authentic writing

                - magazine s and journals that are prepared by leaarners
                - acting out real lfe situations
                - roleplays


                Language is a whole rather than units
                - Bütüncül dil yaklaşımı da denir
                - dil bir bütündür(holistic), bütün olarak öğretilmelidir
                - dildeki beceriler birbirinden ayrılamayacağını savunur

                Facilitator
                Active participant

                Amaç: 
                - dört beceriyi kullanarak insanların iletişim kurmasını sağlamak.
                - Dili sosyal ortamda, gerçek durumlarla kullanabilmeyi sağlamak
                - Yaparak yaşayarak öğrenmeyi amaçlar

                - hem dil, hem de insanlar bütün olarak kabul edilmelidir
                - Constructivism’e dayanır. Yani bilgi sosyal ortamdan edinilir (Vygotsky)
                - Reading- Writing odaklıdır
                - Günlük yaşamda karşılaşılan problemler kullanılmalıdır (Social Practice)
                - Öğrenci merkezli bir yaklaşımdır
                - İş birliği içerisinde çalışmak önemlidir
                - Öğrencinin partner seçimi, fikirleri, aktiviteleri önemlidir. Seçimleri öğrenci yapar


            COMPETENCY BASED LANGUAGE TEACHING APPROACH
                - öğrencileri belli bir bilgi seviyesine getirmeyi amaçlar. Amaç hedefi gerçekleştirmek
                - Dil hem functional hem de interactionaldır
                - değerlendirme yapılırken “norm-referenced” yapılır. Bağıl değerlendirme (diğerleri esas alınarak yapılan değerlendirme) – KPSS
                - methodlar, araçlar, curriculum, design hepsi hedeflere ulaşmak içindir


            COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING (CALL) APPROACH
                - bilgisayar destekli öğrenme ortamı sağlar
                - amaç okullarda yapılan yüz yüze eğitimi bilgisayarla, internetle desteklemek
                1- Behavioristic call
                    davramışçı yaklaşımın prensipleri
                    ders oortamında drilleri tekrar ettirir

                    hem fluency hem accuracy
                    authentic

                 Digital literacy – okur yazarlık
                 Digital native – bu çağda doğanlar
                 Digital immigrant – doğmamış adapteler


                    Computer-Assisted Language Learning 
                        - Integrate technology, Software programs, Internet
                        - Web-based exercise
                        - Applications
                        - Online lessons, Online chat
                        - E-mail, E-magazine
                        - Communicative and Integrative



            LEXICAL APPROACH
                    - Building vocabulary knowledge
                    - Chunks (Phrases, Collocations)

                    - the knowledge of lexicon (kelime ve kelime gruplarını anlamak) as a key term for learning the language
                    - Acquisition w cumulative examples rather than single words (tek tek yerine cümle içinde bir bütün olarak verilir)
                    - the importance of the usage of lexical chunks (kelime grupları) and collacations (do homework gibi)
                    - frequency of lexical items is important (sık sık tekrar)
                    - grammar has a secondary role
                    - teaching is done through lexical chunks
                    - noticing the usages of lexical items
                    - Inducing the rules through examples
                    - Lexical syllabus is used


                    - kelime bilgisi önemli
                    - dil bilgisi ikinci planda
                    - kelime ve kelime kalıpları
                    - amacı hedef dilin akıcı bir şekilde konuşulması
                    - öğrenciler öğrendikleri kelimelerle devamlı olarak karşılaşıp unutmamalarını saplamak
                    - öğrenci kendi öğrenmesinden sorunludur
                    - karşılaştıkları kelimeleri analiz eder not alırlar
                    - Collocations (bir arada kullanılan kelimeler)
                    - lexical syllabus kullanılır (kelimeye dayalı)
                    - kelime öğrenmek için: voc. notebook, repetition, guessing activity, using dict., listening and reading activity kullanılır
                    - 4 beceri arkada kalır ama mükemmel bir kelime haznesi gelişir
                    - Corpus (kelimeleri deftere yazmak ve sürekli tekrar yapmak) oluşturmak ve güçlendirmek




            COOPERATIVE (COLLABORATIVE) LANGUAGE LEARNING APPROACH
                AIM
                - to make learners cooperate, interact and share their knowledge

                - learning occurs as a result of socially-structured exchange of information
                - achieving a common task in pairs or groups
                - cooperation rather than competition
                - fostering motivation and reducing stress
                - members of the groups are chosen by teachers
                - Learners’ autonomy (bireysel katkı bağımsızlıl)
                - individual and group work
                - peer correction
                - teacher is facililator

                5 tane bileşen var prensibi var
                Elements of Cooperative Language Learning
                1- Positive interdependence
                    Birbirilerine dayanma ihtiyaç
                    Birbirlerine rakip değil, biri başarısız ise diğerleri onun açığını kapatır
                2- Individual and Group Accountability 
                   her bir üye değerlendirme ve grubun çalışması ortak değerlendirme, hem bireyin hem de grubun başarısı önemli
                3- Interpersonal skills
                     öğrenciler sosyal beceriler kazanmalı (karar verme, liderlik etc)
                4- Face to Face Promotive Interaction
                     Birbirlerine yardım/destek (Tuck Ambulans yapımı aklına gelsin)
                5- Group processing
                     Her bir öğrencinin grup çalışmasını gözden geçirmesi gerekiyor. 
                     Grubun eksikliklerini görebilmek, hataları fark edebilmek ya da çalışmaları değerlendirebilme becerisi kazanabilmeyi amaçlar


                Techniques (grupla yapılan herşey olabilir)
                - debating and discussion
                - Information gap activities (bilen bilmeyene aktarır)
                - role plays and conversation
                - interviews
                - jigsaw activities (big puzzle, yani aslında herkes ayrı bi modül alıyor)
                - problem solving activities

                - çocuklar için önemli
                - amaç çocukların grupla birlikte çalışması, onlara sosyal beceri sağlamak
                - grup oluşturulmalı. Gruplar seçilerek heterojen olmalı

                        - konu alanı günlük hayata karşılaşılabilecek olaylar olmalı
                        - öğrenciler kendilerine uygun bulduklarını seçerler ve tartışırlar
                        - öğrenci merkezli öğrencilerin yaşantılarını merkeze alır
                        - tartışma ortamı vardır, öğretmen bu tartışma ortamını yöneten kişidir

– TEACHING GRAMMAR
		    Grammar - The system of rules of a languae governing the sounds, words, sentences
		    Form - structure
            Use – production of structure
            Meaning – structure meaning structure

            Approaches to Grammar
                Deductive Teaching Grammar – Grammar rules/strucuture taught directly explicitly
	                Top down (Tümden gelim)
	                        Eg Students are asked to fill in the blanks with appropriate form of verbs presented in brackets according to simple present and future tenses
	                        Before making students do this activity, 
                            the teacher enpower students absorb the sentence formation in the relevant tenses by giving instructions axplicitly
		        Inductive Teaching Grammar – Grammar through examples implicitly
			                The examples are presented first, learners are expected to infer rules, it based on natural acquisition
                            Eg Prepositions: During a grammar class, the teacher gives students some sentences as follows: Some sentences. 
                            After presenting such kinds of activities, 
                            the teacher asks students to fill in the blanks by the suitable preposition in the exercise below….  
			                grammar taught through context

                            Focus on forms – Understanding Grammar structures are important, Choosing and teaching some target rules
                                             Deliberate teaching of Grammar, Primary attention to form 
                                             Communication arka planda
                                             Structure odaklı
                                             Önceden belirlenmiş bir plan dahilindedir
                                             Kurallar explicit olarak verilir
                                             Accuracy 
                                             teaching grammar structures explicitly (deductive)
			
                            Focus on meaning – Meaning is important
					                        Learning through experiencing and communicating 
                                            No deliberate analysis of grammar structures
                                            Anlam odaklıdır
                                            emphasizing the meaning of linguistic forms in a context

			                Focus on form – Communication is important
					                        Integration of form and meaning
					                        Attention to forms arising incidentally
                                            Önceden belirlenmez
                                            Communication sırasında grammar arka planda iletişim önemli
                                            İhtiyaç duyulması halinde grammar kuralları kullanılır
                                            take students attention to a specific structure during communicative activity (değinip geçmek)

                                            Focus on forms ve focus on form birlikte kullanılmalı grammar öğretiminde
                                            
                Stages of Teaching Grammar
				            Presentation
					                    Introducing/teachinggrammar rules (hangi yaklaşım inductive yoksa deductive)
					                    Deductive or Inductive Teaching
					                    Presenting rules in contexts
					                    Awareness is important

                                                and that language change is corruption.

– TEACHING PRONUNCIATION
		                Intelligibility (Kelime Alışılabilirlik önemli – Mesajın ses iletimi) AMAÇ!!
		                	Intelligibility rather than perfection or native-likeness
		                	It refers to forming and hearing sounds in spoken language
		                	to increase it
		                	- studying how speech sounds are articulated
		                	- learning common intonation patterns
		                	- studying sentence stress
		                	- learning different types of word stress
                
		                	Aim is intelligibility and comprehensibility
		                	öğrenci herşeyi doğru söylemek zorunda değil
		                	anlaşılır olmak önemli

		                Comprehensibility: 
                                mesajın açık, net, anlaşılır olması. Mesajın içeriği

		                Requirements for teaching pronounciation
			                    Segmental features – to pronunce speech sounds correctly (vowels, consonants, syllable, words)
					                                Phones, phonemes, allophones           to pronounciate speech sounds correctly
			                    Suprasegmental features – Prosodic features: rhythm, stress(vurgu), intonation(tonlama), pauses(duraksama), pitch(alçalıp yüksel)
					                                        Tones, listening tasks, songs
                                                            minimal pairs, homonym, tongue twister, homophones, constant clusters should be taught
					                                        stress, intonation, pauses
		                
                        Pronunciation ne zaman öğretilmeli
			                    Whole lesson – tüm ders boyunca
			                    Discrete slots – dersin belli bir kısmında
			                    Integrated phases – diğer aktivitelerin içine yedirilmiş şekilde, dersin bir parçası
			                    Opportunitistic Teaching – bulabildiği her fırsatta

		
                        Approaches to Teaching Pronunciation
		                        Intuitive(Imitative) Approach (Sezgisel Yaklaşım)
			                            No explicit instruction
			                            Being exposed to sounds (maruz bırak)
                                        Imitation(taklit) of the sounds/rhythms without any explicit instruction (video) – açık yönerge olmadan
                                        Taklit ile öğrenir 

		                         Analytic(Linguistic) Approach
			                            Telaffuz detaylı öğretilir. Tablolardan öğrenileblir
                                        Explicit information on pronunciation
			                            Articulatory description
			                            Phonetic alphabet and vowel chart (hangi yolla yaptığı)
                                        Rules and Structure are important: Explicit and structured teaching of speech features (konuşma özellikleri açık şekilde veriliyor)
		                                (Current) Integrative Approach – practiced by activities
			                            Ses bilgisi iletişimin ayrılmaz parçasıdır. Suprasegment özelliklere ağırlık verilir
			                            Pronunciation is a crucial part of communication
			                            Practicing through task-based activities
			                            Suprasegmental features rather than sound and word practicing (kelimelerden ziyade anlamlı tasklarda dili kullanarak telafuz)

		                        Techniques of Pronunciation
			                            Songs, Minimal pairs(kelime çiftleri bad, sad), homonyms (eş sesliler), 
                                        tongue twisters, listening tasks, consonant clusters (ünsüzlerin bir araya gelmesi), dictation, suprasegmental exercises 


		                        Pronunciation Activities
			                            Dictation, Intonation exercises, Minimal pairs, Consonant Clusters, Sample Sentence w sounds, Sound charts  

		                        Strategies – Reading
			                            Comprehension tasks should be not too easy/difficult
			                            Reading aloud (pronunciation and intonation)
			                            Silent Reading (Skimming, Scanning, Predicting, Understanding details, and inference)
			                            Guessing the meaning of vocabulary in the text
			                            Making predictions and Inferences
			                            Texts should be authentic and provide purpose for reading

– TEACHING SPEAKING
		Principles in Teaching Speaking
			-increase students motivation (high motivation)
			-use authentic language in real context
			-give feedback to avoid fossilization but dont interrupt
			-create opportunities for students to speak
			-plan and design speaking activities
			-information-gap activities, role play, prob solving activities, using pictures
			-negotiation for meaning 

		Speaking esnasında öğretmen hem accuracy(hatasız), hem de fluency(açık) odaklı olmalı
			Öğretmen authentic-meaningful materyaller kullanmalı
			Speaking and listening ilişkilendirilmelidir
			Öğrenci konuşmak için motive edilmelidir
			Öğretmen feedback vermelidir
			İletişim genellikle yüzyüze olur
			Mimik jest kullanılmalı
			Genelde düşünmeden spontane konuşuruz. 
			Bu yüzden konuşma boşlıklarını doldurmak için I mean, you know gibiifadeler kullanabiliriz
		
		Aim
			To achieve communicative efficiency
		
		Speaking Process
			Absorbing input
				Bilgi sunulur ve alınır
			Negotiating meaning (işleme süreci)
			Production (Output)


	Types of Speaking (Purpose of speaking)
			Interactional Speech (vs noninteractional speech)
				social function vs focus on message
				Sosyal ilişkiler ön planda
				Amaç iletişim kurmak
			Transactional Speech (vs interpersonal/interactinal speech)
				focus on message vs social function
				Bir konu hakkında bilgi aktarmak amaçlanır
				Önemli olan karşı tarafın anlamasıdır
				Ders anlatmak, sunum örnek olabilir
			Planned Speech
				Önceden planlanmış konuşmalardır
				Sunumlar
			Unplanned Speech
				Plansız, hazırlıksız konuşmalardır
			Imitative Speech
				Duyulan şeyi tekrar ettiğimiz konuşmalardır
			Responsive speech
				Karşı tarafın cevap verdiği konuşmadır



		Approaches to Teaching Speaking
			Input Focused Approaches (dinleyici neye dikkat ediyor)
				1- Content-oriented input
					Information
					Meaning is the central point of the input
					In the form of Listening and Reading
					Utilizing different subjects as input
				2- Form-oriented input
					Yapıların doğru kullanımı
					The emphasis on how to the language is used
					Noticing vocabulary, pronunciation, and forms
					Dil nasıl kullanılmalı , voc, grammatical structure, 

					Linguistic competence
					Discourse Competence
					Sociolinguistic Competence 
					Strategic Competence
				Listening activities
				Reading activities
				Language that is heard anywhere
				Teacher talk

			Output Focused Approaches (konuşmacı neye dikkat ediyor)
				Producing oral language
				1- Structured Output
					Using forms accurately – grammatical structure
					Accuracy is the core point
				2- Communicative Output
					Fluency rather than Accuracy (Accuracy fluencye engel olmayacak kadar da olmalı)
					Completing a task
					Language communication
					Target

			SPEAKING PROBLEMS						SOLUTIONS
			----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			- Fear of mistakes, losing face					- Group work
			- Low participation						- Support the students
			- L1 use  (ana dil kullanımına yatkınlık)			- Errors not noticed
			- Accuracy (hata yaptığında bekle)				- Low inhibition – fear
			- Fluency (önemli olan akıcılık bozmadan okusun)		- Careful with topic choice
			- Accuracy vs Fluency						- Clear purpose is important
											- Encourage students with group works 
											- High motivation
											- Instructions should be clear

						
			Types of questions
				clarification check          		– I didnt understand, what do you mean?
				comprehension check   		 	– Do you understand?  yes/no
				confirmation check (tag questions) 	- The question is easy, isnt it?


			Communication Strategy
				Konuşmacının iletişim esnasında karşılaştığı problemleri çözmek amacıyla kullanılır
				Strategic Competence’a hizmet eder
			1- Approximation
				Kelimenin aslını kullanmak yerine anlam açısından yakın olabilecek başka bir kelimenin kullanılması
			2- Word Coinage
				Konuşmacı kelimenin aslı yerine tamamen yeni bir kelime kullanır
				Regretness gibi..
			3- Foreignizing
				Yabancı sözcüklerleboşlukları doldurmak
			4- Circumlocution
				Anlatmak istenilen kelimeyi tek kelimeyle ifade edemeyip lafo dolandırarak, birden fazla kelimeyle aktarmaktır
			5- Topic Avoidance
				Konuşmacının yetersizlik sebebiyle konuşmaktan kaçması (kelime-dil bigisi eksikliği)
			6- Message abandonment
				Konuşmacının konuşmayı devam ettirememesi

			öğrenciler bunu bilmeli hazır olmalı ve beklentimiz bunlar
			- spoken discourse with back-channels (hmm, well…)
			- a speech contains errors and slips
			- speech may be formal or casual
			- first, input should be given
			- then, structured output, then communicative output
			- choose a topic, make small-talk, turn talking, opening and closing conversations

> Factor Affecting Language Learning  2 soru
		# 01. LINGUISTIC FACTORS
			Teoriler kısmında değinildi
			01. Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH)
				- hedef dil ile ana dil arasındaki benzerlik v farklılıkları inceler
				- Dil öğrenim sürecinde ortaya çıkabilecek olası hataları engellemeye çalışır

				Alm içinde var
				A systematic analysis of L1 and L2 to identify their differences and similarities
				Ana dil ikinci dili öğrenmede zorluk çıkarıyor
				- öğrenim süresinde yapılan hataların sebebi ana dil ile hedef dil arasındaki farklılıklardır
				“interlingual error – negative transfer”

			02. Interlingual errors
				Interlanguage (learner language)
				- hem hedef dilden hem de ana dilden farklı olarak geliştirilen ikinci dil öğrenen bireylerin öğrenirken kullandıkları dildir. 
					Hiç birşeye benzemiyor
				- bireye özgüdür, sürekli gelişim gösterir
				- a language developed by a single learner during the process of learning a language
				- a language that is neither L1 nor L2
				- it is unique to a single learner
				- it is not thoroughly independent of L1 and the target language

				Interference
				     The effect of L1 on a learner’s progress in the target language
				     - negative transfer
				        Applying the knowledge of L1 to the tagert language and committing error
				     - positive transfer
				        Applying the knowledge of L1 to the target language and learning sth that is common for the two languages easily
 
			02. Intra-Linguage Errors (öğrenilen dil dahilindeki hatalar)
				Simplification
					-using easy structures instead of complex ones
					-using simple past tense instead of present perfect tense
					(yapılan bir eylem eğer geçmiş zaman zarfları belirtmemiş ise present perfect kullanılır)
				Overgeneralization
					-applying a rule to other examples to which it cannot be applied
					-- there are two womans...
				Overextension
					-using a word too broadly
					-using the same word for many things
				Hypercorrection
					-a type of error that results from excessive correction
				Underextension
					-using a word to narrowly
					-using the same word for only one thing
					-baba kelimesinin sadece kendi babasına dendiğini sanıyor
				Misoerdering
					-a type of error that occurs when the position of a word or morpheme in an expression arranged wrongly
				Addition
					-adding a word or morpheme that is unnecessary
					He doesnt speaks 
					Nobody isnt happy
				Omission/Avoidance (çıkarma, eksiklik)
					-a type of error that occurs when a necessary word or morpheme is missing
					He like chocolate
					Where you from?

			03. MISTAKE vs ERROR

				-errors occur due to incorrect application, wrong guessing, due to overgeneralization
				Dil öğrenen bireylerin yaptığı hataları inceleyip, sebeplerini açıklamaya çalışan sisteme denir
				Hataların kaynağı interlanguage’dir
				Hatalar kuralların yanlış kullanımından, aşırı genellemelerden kaynaklanabilir (Overgeneralization)

				ERROR ANALYSIS AŞAMALARI
					1- Collection of Data: 		Hata tespiti yapılır
					2- Identification of errors: 	Hatalar mistake mi yoksa error mu?
					3- Description of Error: 	Yapılan hatanın türü nedir?
					4- Explanation of Error: 	Hatanın nedeni nedir?
					5- Error Evaluation: 		Hangi hatayı düzeltmeliyim?

			05. SOURCE OF ERRORS

				positive feedback and negative feedback

				Types of Corrective Feedback
					1- Explicit Correction
					     doğrudan düzeltilen hatadır. Hata olduğu an düzelt. Açık şekilde
					     presenting corrective feedback directly
					      “you must say”, “u cant say lately” “this is not correct”
					      Hatanın söylendiği tek tür

					2- Recast, Reformulation, Echo Correction (echoing by fixing)
					     Öğretmen, öğrencinin cümlesini hatalı kısmı doğrusuyla değiştirerek tekrar eder. Dile getirmeden düzelt
					     Presenting the correct form of student’s error without telling him/her that s/he has committed an error
     
					3- Clarification Request
					    Bu teknikte öğretmen “excuse me?”,  “sorry”, “pardon” vs ifadelerle öğrenciye hatalı olduğunu ima eder

					       Eliciting the correct form from the learner by questions or deliberate pauses 
					       Do we say “..error..” ama do we say like that? Deseydi metalinguistic olurdu
					       With pause – he is interested...error..

					6- Repetition/Echoing
					       Hatalı cümle olduğu gibi öğretmen tarafından tekrar edilir, hatalı kısım öğrenciye hissettirilir
					       Repeating a learner’s error together with changes in intonation(tonlama) to make her/him notice it     
       
					7- Hinting
					      Öğrenciye hatasını düzeltmesi için ipucu verilir, tercih sunulur
					      Update: A learner’s response to a corrective feedback presented

---> Theories of Languages and Cognitive Development
		Piaget
			bilişsel kuram
			-interaction with the environment
			-experience and cognitive development
			-development occurs as a result of assimilation and accommodation
			-çocuklar analiz ederek, kafasındaki şemaları kullanarak öğrenirler
			-öğrenme somut deneyimlerle gerçekleşir
			-çocuklar öğrenirken aktif olmalı, problem çözmeli
			-bilişsel gelişim iki şekilde gerçekleşir
			1. Assimilation (Özümseme)
			     çocuğun yeni öğrendiği bilgiyi, kendisinde var olan şemanın içine yerleştirmelidir : köpeği biliyordur kediyi görünce ona da köpek der
			     sth is learnt or an action takes place without anychange in a child’s existing schema
			     fitting a new information or idea into what is already known
			---seeing a lion and calling it cat
			     bilgi değişir depo değişmez
			2. Accomadation (Uyumsama)
			     Yeni karşılaştığı durumu anlayabilmek için yeni şema oluşturmasıdır: köpeği biliyordur kediyi görünce o da kedi olur
			     bilgi değişmez depo değişir	
			     Adjusting to the environment to get new information
			     fitting the schema to new information
			     understanding that not all four-legged animals are cat
		
		
		Stages of Piaget’s Cognitive Development
			(Child development stages)
			1- Sensorimotor Stage (0-2) duyuşsal motor
			     - çocuğun hareketleri reflexe dayalıdır
			     - bebek kendini dış dünyadan ayırt edemez
			     - fiziksel davranış odaklıdır (emme-tutma)
			    - senses and basic motor activities
			     - reflexes, habits
			     - object performance – nesne sürekliliği
			     - imitation
			     - trial and error experiments
			
			2- Pre-Operational stage (2-7) (işlem öncesi)
			      - çocuk ben merkezci düşünür (egocentricity)
			      - dil öğrenmede çok yeteneklidir
			      - sürekli konuşurlar, ama tek taraflı
			      - bilişsel olgunluğa ulaşmamışlardır
			      - deyimleri, soyut kavramları anlayamazlar
			      - egocentricity
			      - linguistics abilities
			      - no logical reasoning
			
			3- Concrete Operational Stage (7-11) (somut işlemler)
			       - okul çağıdır, erken çocukluk dönemi
			       - çocuklar esnek düşünce yapılarına sahip
			       - somut öğrenmeler baskındır
			       - dil, somut ve iletişimsel bir araçtır
			       - parça-bütün ilişkisini görmeye başlarlar
			       - logical reasoning
			       - problem solving but under concrete facts and objects
			       - no structures of language and metalanguage
			       - no abstract concepts
				
			4- Formal Operational Stage (12 +)(soyut işlemler)
			      - soyut kavramları anlayıp, kullanabilirler
			      - ergenliğe yakın çocukluktur
			      - empati becerisi gelişir
			      - dil kurallarını anlamaya başlarlar
			      - abstract concepts
			      - structures of language to understand
 
		Vygotsky
			-sosyal çevrenin bilişsel gelişimde önemi dikkat çekilir
			-yetişkin rolü önemli olan diğer faktördür
			-bilgi sosyal ortamda yetişkin yardımıyla öğrenilir (a knowledgable other)
			-social interaction and development
			-the support of adults - scaffolding
			-zone of proximal development

			Scaffolding – yapı iskelesi
			- öğretmenin ilk aşamalarında öğrenciyi büyük ölçüde destekleyerek, 
				zaman geçtikçe bu desteği azaltarak, en son çocuğun sorumluluk almasını saplamaktadır
			- öğretmenin kademeli yardımıdır
			- support for abilities in ZPD

			Zone of Proximal development (yakınsak gelişim alanı)
			-a range of abilities for which a child needs an adult’s assistance or guidance
			-çocuğun kendi yapabileceği beceri ile yetişkin yardımıyla yapabileceği bir üst bilgi beceri seviyesindeki farka denir


		Bruner
			-the importance of language for cognitive development
			-the way adults use language
			-repetitions and routines
			-understanding children’s needs
			-preparing effective tasks
			-motherese

			Motherese
			-a simplified language used by adults to communicate with a child and make input comprehensible
			-slow, simplified, changed intonation

			kullanılan dil, materyal, ortam çocuğun bilişsel, duyşsal becerilerine uygun olmalı
			Motherese Speech (Caretaker speech, caregiver speech, child-directed talk)

	Material Development
		Materials
Dictionary, Grammar Book, Phrasebook, Flash Card, Audio Book, Recording Device, 
Sound Editor, Electronic Translator, Dialogue, Songs, Radio Program

		Principles of material development
			Materials should be interesting, attractive, up-to-date and various
			Materials should be free of errors
			Materials should motivate students and eliminate anxiety
			Materials should foster authentic language use
			Materials should be ordered from simple to complex ones
			Materials should be related to learners’ such as learning styles, affective filters
			Materials should be perceived as useful and relevant
			Materials should foster the use of learner-centered approaches
			Materials must be related to communicative purposes
			Materials must make learners notice structures and meaning both consciously and unconsciously
			Materials must be flexible and source rather than a guideline
			Materials must be designed to offer feedback
			Materials must be goal oriented
			
		The process of material development
			1- Identification
				Identifying a need for material development
				Identifying a problem to be solved for educational purposes
				Teacher or learners
			2- Exploration
				Exploration of the needs in terms of language areas, functions and skills
			3- Contextual (bağlam) realization
				Contexts and texts are prepared for language that are determined
			4- Pedagogical realization
				Developing suitable exercises and activities
			5- Physical Production
				External factors such as shape, visuals, length, format

		Materials Adaptation
			Materyallerin uyarlanması, değiştirilmesi
			What is the reason for materials adaptation?
			-changes based on needs
			-these needs are based on internal and external factors
			External factors: 
          			learners’ features, age, learning style, proficiency level, 
         			motivation, intelligence, aptitude, interests, mother tongue
			Internal factors:  öğrencinin özellikleri dışında kalan bütün faktörler
           			Content, themes, educational context, time, teachers, communicative purposes

			Objectives of Materials adaptation – amaç neden
				1- Localization
					Altering the material according to the region where students live 
					Making material relevant and appropriate
					Contextual appropriateness
				2- Individualization
					Changing material to relate it to the learners’ learning styles
				3- Personalization
                                  	Changing material to relate it to the learners’ personal interests, background and experiences  
				4- Modernization
					Updating the content that is outdated
					Changing the material to make it up-to-date.		


		Material adaptation techniques
			Material according to their purpose
			1. Authentic Materials
				Materials that are created, written and published for native speakers
				Materials that are not created, written and published for educational purpose, but we use
			2. Instructional Materials
				Materials that are created for learners
				Pedagogical purposes
				Materials used to make learnng easier, quicker and more more enjoyable

 			Material Types (Materials according to their type)
			1. Informative Materials
				The materials that present information to learners
				Eg, Advertisement, Recipe, Dict, Map, Table, Menu, Brochure, Instruction, Grammar book, Course book 
				Amacı iletişimi sağlayıp, bilgi vermektir
				Yazılı veya sözlü olabilir (katalog, menü, broşür..)

			2. Narrative Materials
				The materials that are based on narrative
				The materials narrating a fiction or a real story
				Eg. Story, Novel, Tongue twister, Diary, Fable, Chant, Cartoon, Poem, Song, Play
				Genellikle yazılı/sözlü eserlerden narrative materials olarak bahsedilir
				Öğrencinin seviyesinde kalıplar, yapılar içerir
				Ders ortamında kullanılmak için oluşturulmamış, 
					dersle alakalı olmayan materyallerin ders ortamında kullanılabilmesine denir (şarkı, şiir, hikaye, roman…)

			3. Interactive Materials
				The materials that foster interaction and communication between learners, in groups or pairs
				Eg. Conversation, Dialogue, Letter, Email, Role play cards
				İletişim odaklı materyallere denir
				Amacı iletişim kurulmasını sağlamaktır (sohbet, mesaj, mail)


		Materyal nasıl geliştirilmeli
			-İlgi çekici olmalıdır
			-öğrenciye onun ilgilerine, özelliklerine, seviyesine (hazırbulunuşluk) hitap etmelidir
			-dili özgün kullandırtmalı, etkileşim kurmaya yöneltmelidir
			-öğrenciye bir şeyleri başarma duygusu hissettirilmeli
			-öğrencinin iletişim kurmasına olanak sağlamalıdır
			-öğrencide kültürel farkındalık oluşturulmalıdır
			-öğrencilerin kendilerini değerlendirmelerine olanak sağlanmalı
			-role play, pair work, gibi iletişimsel aktivitelerleiş birliği duygusunu öğrenciye aşılamalıdır
			-öğrenci materyal kullanırken kendini rahat hissetmelidir
			-materyal gerçek hayata uygun olmalıdır

		Materyal Geliştirmenin belli başlı adımları
			Identification
				-bir konu öğretildiği zaman, o konuyla ilgili ihtiyaçların belirlendiği adımdır
				-öğrenci yada öğretmen tarafından belirlenir
			Exploration
				-öğretilecek konu ile alakalı araştırmaların yapıldığı aşamadır
			Contextual Realisation
				-Hazırlanacak olan materyalin kullanılabileceği uygun ortam oluşturulur
			Pedagogical Realisation
				-Materyallerin kullanılabileği aktiviteler, etkinlikler, alıştırmalar belirlenir
			Physical Production
				-Materyalin fiziksel özelliği, boyutu, rengi, şekli, görünüşü belirlenir


		Materials Adaptation
			Materyali uyarlama haline denir
			Öğrencinin bireysel beceri, özellikleri, ilgileri, ihtiyaçlarına göre 
			ya da öğretmenin materyali daha kullanışlı olarak sunmasına olanak sağlamak için 
			materyali değiştirme ya da yeniden biçimlendirme haline getirmektir

			1. Objectives of Adaptation
				Localization
					Materyali yaşanılan yere, topluma, çevreye göre uyarlayarak yeniden düzenlemek
 				Personalization
					Materyali içerik olarak öğrencinin istek, ilgi, ihtiyacına göre uyarlamaya denir
					Yani her öğrenciye kendi ilgi alanlarına göre materyal hazırlamaktır 
					(ilköğretim oyunlu, müzikli materyal gibi)
				Individualization
					Her öğrenci farklı öğrendiği için, bireysel farklılıklar göz önüne alınarak 
					onların öğrenme tarzını göre materyal hazırlamak
					(kinesthetic spatial vs)
				Modernization
					Materyalin içerik olarak, dil bilgisi olarak güncellenmesi, zamana uyarlanmasına denir


		2. Materials’ Adaptation Techniques
				Addition
					Materyal eksik olduğunda öğretmenin materyale ekleme yapmasına denir
					Aktivite, alıştırma, eksik konu gibi eklemeler yapılabilir
					Adding more content, activity, exercise etc. to the material when it is not enough
					- Extending
						Aynı türden ekleme yapma – var olan içeriğe ekliyor
						Increasing the quantity of the material
						Adding the same/similar activities, content, questions
						Bir konuda 5 dy sorusu varsa eksik diye 5 D-Y daha eklenir
					- Expanding
						Farklı türden ekleme yapma  - içerik var ediyor
						Both qualitative and quantitive – nitelik hem de nicelik ekleme
						Increasing the quantity and changing the quality of the material
						Change in the methodology
						Developing the methodology
						5 DY sorusu var, öğretmen bir de boşluk doldurma sorusu ekler
				Deletion / Omiting
					Öğrencinin ihtiyacından fazlasını silme anlamına gelir
					Omitting some parts of the materials
					- Substracting
						Diminishing the quantity of material without any change in the methodology
						Omitting the parts that are not necessary or appropriate
						Sayısal olarak aynısından silme anlamına gelir – miktar olarak
						25 tane DY varsa fazla bulup 5 DY silmek
					- Abridging
						Both qualitative and quantitive
						Diminishing the quantity of material and changing the methodology
						Omitting some parts that are seen unnecessary or irrelevant
						Hem niceliksel, hem niteliksel azalmaya denir
						10 dil bilgisi boşluk sorusu, 10 konuşma 2şer tanesini fazla görüp çıkartmak

				Simplifying
					Changing the elements of materials to maket hem less complex
					Changing instructions, explanations, exercises, activitiesi and content to make em easier 
					Materyalin, dilinin, özelliklerinin, aktivitelerinin  zorluk düzeylerinin basitleştirilmesi
					Değişiklik yapılan üç kısım..
						1. Sentence Structure
						-Reducing the length of a sentence
						-Paraphrasing the sentences
                     				-Changing the conjunctions and simplifiying complex compound sentences
						2. Lexical Content
						-Reducing the number of complex and unknown words in the material
						-changing  the complex words with easier ones
						3. Grammatical Structures and Content
						-transforming grammatical structures
						-from passive to active clauses
						-changing the difficult contents
				
				Modifying
					Changing the nature of the material
					Changing the approach
					Changing the focus of attention
					Materyalin içeriğinde artma veya azalma söz konusu değildir
					Mevcut materyalin türü, hedef davranışları gibi özellikleri değiştirilir
					Re-writing
					-Materyalin içeriğinin yeniden yazılıp düzenlenmesi
					-changing the content of the material to relate it to the learners’ personal interests, background, culture and experiences
					-İngilizce metinin içeriğinin türkçeleştirilmesi
					Re-structuring
					-bireyseli gruplama şekillerinde değişiklik yapar – sınıfa göre değiştirmek uzun ise
					-Changing the structure of activities or tasks for purposes concerning class management
					-Interactional patterns of the activities and tasks are changed
					-turning an individual activity into group activity
				
				Re-ordering
					Materyalin konusunda, aktivitelerindei sıralamalarında değişiklik yapmak
					İlk üniteyi anlatmayıp önce üçüncü üniteyi anlatmak, sıralamayı değiştirmek
					Changing the order of the certain parts of the material
					Sequencing the activities and tasks differently
				
				Branching
					Materyaldeki aktiviteye alternatif olarak öğrencilere başka seçenekler hakkı sunmak
					Şubeleme – bir şeyin alternatifi fazla seçenek
					Adding more activities to a task or activity
					Providing more options to students
				
				Replacement (Substituting)
					Materyalde yer alan aktiviteyi aynı amaca hizmet eden başka aktiviteyle değiştirmek
					Substituting certain tasks, activities or a certain parts of the material with different ones

			Materials Evaluation (Neden değerlendirme yaparız)
				Materyal güvenilir mi
				Geçerli mi
				Amaca hizmet ediyor mu
				Öğrencinin ihtiyaçlarını karşılıyor mu
				Öğrencileri motive ediyor mu
				Öğretim sürecine yardım ediyor mu
				Esnek mi - 	İlginç mi
				Assessment of the strength and weakness of materials
				A systematic collection and analysis of data is necessary
				
			The reasons for material evaluation
				To see the effectiveness and efficiency of materials
				To see how much materials facilitate the learning
				To see the weaknesses of materials
				To identify necessary revisions
				To identify the strength of materials
