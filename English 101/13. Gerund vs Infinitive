---> Fillden isim yapma
INFINITIVE        --- to go
GERUND            --- going
                            * Bazı cümlelerde 'gizli preposition' olabilir. Bu yüzden gerund kullanılır. Bunun anlamı, fiilin isimleşmesidir. 
                              Çünkü her preposition sonrasında isim/noun ya da pronoun/zamir alır.
                            * Sıfat/Adjective sonrası infinitive kullanılır.
