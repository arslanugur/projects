01- Greetings

		WARNING:
		* do not consume a lot of time giving your self-introduction
		* the first impression is the last impression - hand shake
		* when you’re talking, smile and look them in the eyes self-confidently..
		* presenting yourself as knowledgeable and confident shows your potential employers that you’re the right choice for the opportunity
		* dont ask ‘what do you want to know?’. It shows that you are not prepared.
		* when you think you should be defending in your mind, you should be offending / attacking more
		* Using Some High Impact Words include some high-impact words in your answer such as 
			Adapt		Design		Prepare		Conduct		Implement	Promote
			Develop		Improve		Maintain	Control		Supervise	Increase
			
		* YOU NEED TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITHOUT ANY FOREWARNING, THEREFORE YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED
		* PREWRITING IS A MUST
                * You're as much as you tell about yourself - Kendini anlattığın kadarsındır.
