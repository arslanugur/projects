Example:
Some of my friends think I have a boring daily routine, but I like it.  
I usually get up at about 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, after my alarm clock wakes me up.    
First, I brush my teeth, and shave, and wash my face.  
Then, I get dressed and go downstairs to have breakfast with my family. 
I always have coffee, cereal, and lots of fruit.  That’s me in the picture with my wife.  
I take a bus to work because I don’t like to drive, 
and I always arrive at my office before 8:00.  I’m never late for work.  
Five o’clock is my favorite time of the day because I finish work 
and go home and see my wife and two children again.  
We eat dinner together in our dining room at around 6:00, 
and after that I hang out with my wife and kids at home.  
We really enjoy watching our favorite TV programs together, but two or three times a week   
I do exercise in the evening, so I can stay strong and healthy.  
This is very important!  Finally, at about 9:30, I go to bed, read for a while, 
and then fall asleep. Sure, some people think my daily routine is a little boring – 
but on weekends and holidays I love to fly airplanes for fun!
