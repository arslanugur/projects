---> Properties of Language
		- Arbitraries (Rasgelelik)
                	No logical connection between a word and its meaning
			"Car" is named in this way arbitrarily. No reason why we call this vehicle as car
		
		- Displacement (Yer v Zaman anlamında dilin sınırı yok)
			No limitation in language in terms of time, place or object while speaking
			We can talk about past and future
			We can talk about things that are not present

			Every language has sounds that are unique
			Each sound in the language is different from others

				they are unique
				they can be combined with other sounds to produce limitless messages

		- Cultural Transmission (Kültür Aktarımı)
			Language is transmitted to future generations by culture
			It is not transmitted genetically

		- Productivity (Creativity)
			Language allows us to produce as many sentences we want or we can
			We can talk as much as we can by language
			We can produce limitless utterances they have never been heard
			Herkes aynı resme bakarak farklı cümleler kurabilir

		- Reflexivity
			Using language to talk about itself
			
		- Recursiveness (Uzatılarak tekrarlılık)
			Same structures of language can be used to produce longer utterances
				“I went to mall“
				“I went to mall and bought a pair of sneakers”
				“I went to mall, bought a pair of sneakers anda te pizza”

	How the part of the speech are ordered
	How words and phrases are put together to form sentences

		Generative Grammar (Chomsky)
			A type of grammar that refers to language as a set of formal rules formulated to produce innumerable grammatical structures

			Structures of a language are handled within two levels:
				Deep Structure
					Abstract structures
					It helps us to understand sentences
					Active and affirmative sentences 
					Michael washes the car (deep structure)
				
				Surface Structure
					Actually produced concrete sentences
					Derived from deep structure by transformations (cümlelerle oynamak)
					It can be heard, read and spoken
					The car is washed by Michael (surface structure)
					It is Michael, who washes the car (surface structure)
					The person who washes the car is Michael (surface structure)

> Neurolinguistics
	The branch of linguistics that focus on the relationship between language learning and brain
	Parts of brain that is responsible fort he storing the information of human language
	Parts of brain that is responsible for language production

	1- PARTS OF BRAIN
		--Corpus Callosum
			Sağ ve sol arasındaki ilişkiyi belirleyen bölge
			A region that connects the right and left hemispheres of the brain
		--Cerebellum
			A part of brain that controls motor movements
			Control, balance and coordination
			Vücut hareketleri yönlendiren dengeyi sağlayan kısım
		--Right and Left Hemisphere
			Two hemispheres exist in the brain
	
	2- LANGUAGE AREAS IN THE BRAIN
		--Broca’s Area
			A region in the brain that is responsible for speech production
			Konuşma fabrikası denilebilir –konuşmamızı sağlar
		--Wernicke’s Area

			Tongue, Jaw, Face (dilimizi kullanırken kullandığımız kaslar)
		--Arcuate Fasciculus
			A region in the brain that is responsible for the connection between Borca’s and Wernicke’s area
			Konuşmaya cevap verirken ve algılamada devreye girer ve arasındaki bağlantıdan sorumlu
	
	3- Lateralization

			Creativity
			Imagination and Intuition
			Artistic
			Visualizing
		--Left Hemisphere
			Objective
			Looks at part

				“I took a shower”  “I shook a tower”
		-- Malapropism
			Spoonerism ile karıştırma
			A speaker uses a wrong word instead of another one as they have similar sounds
			Bir kelimenin yerine başka bi kelime kullanımı
			“She is good at predicating” predicate ile predict farklı kelimeler (yanlış kullanmış)
			“I want two tenor slices of chicken” ”tender” olmalı

		-- Slip of Ear
			Anlık olarak dinlemede yanlış anlamak
			An error of comprehension during listening
			Misperception of what is heard
			“but try the best”  “butter the best” olarak anlamak
			Benzer sesler yüzünden farklı şekilde anlamak

>First Language Acquisition
	The first lang a person learns -- The native language
		Acquisition – bilinçsiz bi şekilde öğrenmek edinim
		Learning – bilinçli bir şekilde öğrenmek
	--First language acquisition
		The process by which children acquire their native language
	--Input
		The things children hear
		**structural input – çocuklarla iletişim kurmak bilgiyi vermek için seviyesine inmek demek
			Motherese, caretaker, parentese, child-directed speech simplified language
	--Pre-Language stages
		- cooing/gooing		0-6 months
			Sounds such as /k//g/
		
		- babbling		6-8 months
			Syllables –heceler başlar
		
		- one-word stage/holophrastic stage/single unit stage	9-18 months
			Producing one word (dog, cat)
			Or single unit utterances (come on!)
		
		- two-word stage		18-24 moths
			Combining words (more milk, no bed, our car)

		- telegraphic stage	2-3 years
			Telegraf gibi konuşuyor
			Three-four words sentences
			Some grammatical sentences – özne yüklem nesne gibi
			Problem with inflections – yani s takısı gibi 
		
	The Acquisition Process
		- Acquisition of phonology
			Bütün dünya dillerinde - Hangi sırayla, çocuklar sesleri kavrayabilirler? 
			1-Acquiring common sounds such as p,b,s,m,d,k
			2-vowels
			3-manner of articulation: Nasal, Stops, Glides, Liquids, Fricative, Affricate (duruma şekle göre)
			4-place of articulation: labials, velars, alveolars, palatal (teleafuz edilen yere göre)
		
		- Acquisition of Semantics
			Limited words during holophrastic stage – kelime dağarcığı yetersiz
			As a type of errors, Overextension – Calling four whelled-vehicles as car
			Calling all round objects as ball
	  		Around 5 years old – antonyms (go-come) semantic relationship
		
		- Acquisition of Morphology
			As a type of errors, Overgeneralization
			“Mummy goed”, “two mans”
			İlk aşamada çocuk…
			--Present progressive kullanmayı öğreniyor ”I playing”
			--preposition “at home”
 			--plural “balls”
			--irregular past “daddy went”
			--possessives “mummy’s hat”
			--U-Shape Learning (spent-spended-spent) –öğrendiğiniz noktaya geri dönmek
		
		- Acquisition of Syntax
			Cümle dizimiyle ilgili
			--questions nasıl elde edilir üç aşamalı
				Stage1:“where mummy”, “mummy there?”
				Stage2:”where mummy going”,”you like ball”
				Stage3:”can i have food”,”will you come”
			
			--negatives
				Stage1: “no come here”,”not go there”
				Stage2:”I cant play”, “I dont like Mummy not go”, “mummy not go”
				Stage3:”she wont come”,”i didnt play”
				At last: “isnt” is used
	
		- Approaches to Language Acquisition
			--Social Interaction Approach
				Vygotsky, bruner, krashen, piaget
			--Behaviorism
				Skinner
				Imitation, memorization and repetition
				Habit formation
				Reinforcement
			--Nativist Approach
				Chomsky
				Innatism
				Language acquisition is innately determined
				Language acquisition device (LAD) -Dil için bir mekanizma var yeni doğan bebekte
				Doğuştan var sonradan harekete geçiyor
				Poverty of Stimulus –kendisinden beklenenin aksine çocuk umulmadık şey söyleyebilir
				Bu doğuştan programlı oluşunun kanıtı olarak görülüyor
				Universal grammar konusu var o da grammer türüdür konu dışı
