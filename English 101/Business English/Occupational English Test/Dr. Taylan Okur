Dear Dr Stevens,

Your patient, Sally Fletcher, was admitted to the surgical ward of Fairbanks Memorial Hospital on 25 March 2018 
      for the purpose of laparoscopic surgery to treat an endometrial cyst. She is now ready for discharge into the care of her husband.
When admitted, Sally had been suffering from painful periods over the past 3 years, which she had been attempting to treat with naproxen, 
      but the pain persisted. An ultrasound scan revealed a cyst had formed in her abdomen. 
She arrived at the ward this morning and underwent laparoscopic surgery, which successfully located and removed a 6cm cyst from her abdomen without complication.
She has been advised to keep the incision sites clean and dry. 
She has received narcotic pain medication and has been advised that she is unable to drive while taking this medication. 
You should monitor her progress, and advise when to cease taking this medication. She may resume driving 24-48 hours after the last dose is taken.
Sally may resume her normal diet today, and is encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. She is also encouraged to walk as much as she can tolerate.
Sexual activity can resume in two weeks.

"If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
Yours sincerely,
Doctor
