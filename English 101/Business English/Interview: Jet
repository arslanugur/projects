      02. How would you deal with an irate customer?
          Have you dealt with a difficult customer? and give an example.
            I know sometimes customers may be upset or unhappy 
            with their experience with a particular product or service 
            and will contact the company to let them know. 
            I would acknowledge their feelings and concerns, 
            and inform them that I would be more than happy to assist them with resolving the problem. 
            After exhausting all available resources, 
            if I could not rectify the situation, 
            I would let the customer know that 
            I can put them in touch with a supervisor who can help them if necessary.


      03. Name 3 qualities about yourself that would make you perfect for the job?
            I am passionate about my work.
            I am ambitious and driven.
            I am highly organized.
            I'm a people-person.
            I'm a natural leader.

            I am an excellent communicator.




      04. Name 4 qualities about yourself that would make you perfect for the job?
      04. What is going to be the most challenging part of this job?
            When buyers ask a question i cannot answer. 
            This is a chance for me as the face of Jet to direct the customer down the right path, 
            or, if possible, retrieve the information myself. 
            Even without a concreate answer, a question should never be met with a shrug of the shoulders.

      05. What experience do you have in assisting customers?
            I never pretend to know an answer. 
            If I'm unsure how to help a customer, 
            I try to find out for the customer and take steps for a solution. 
            Honestly, I worked for many years in tourism. 
            So, I helped many people in resorts for easy or difficult situations 
            and if I didn't know an answer, 
            I reached out to my co-workers or my supervisors for assistance. 
            In brief, I have self-confidence and problem-solving skills.

      06. What would you do if a passenger told you they had paid for private transport to their resort and it hadn't shown up?
            I try to do everything in my power to ensure to find what has happened to the customers transport and assist them in solving the problem. 
            If I can't solve this, I will find either a senior or other service who can.

      07. What would you do if a passenger told you they had paid for private transport to their hotel but you found out they hadn't?
            A policy and procedure would be in place for this situation 
            but I would do my best to find if something has gone wrong and assist the customer to have a nice holiday.


What would you recommend and why would you recommend it?

Dalaman Region Itinerary 
            --> Sarigerme Market
                  There is a Market on every Sunday in Sarigerme Village which is purpose build touristic market, 
                  it is a ripp off and Stall owners in the market can be some times pushy, annoying and rude
            
            --> The Dalyan River
                  By far my favourite part of this trip, the Dalyan area is Turkey’s little gem, 
                  I would say hidden gem but it’s far from it, being one of the most visited attractions in this area. 
                  Yet remarkably I hadn’t heard of it and after a day exploring I was left wondering why. 
                  As a day trip the Dalyan has so much to offer. 
                  We had a private luxury boat take us out to see along the river, along winding routes through the reeds and down to the sea.

                  My first impression of this place “it’s simply stunning”. 
                  As we cruised along the laid-back river we stopped at a restaurant famous for the visiting Loggerhead Sea Turtle, wait what, sea turtles? 
                  Yes. This area is now a protected breeding ground for the ‘Caretta caretta (Loggerhead) Sea Turtle, and you have every chance of seeing them.
                  
              --> The Lycian Rock Tombs
                  The boat then passes another infamous landmark, the Lycian Rock Tombs, several huge carvings overlooking the landscape. 
                  These imposing tombs are estimated to date back to 400 BC and are the resting place of the Kings from the ancient city of Kaunos. 
                  They’re breath-taking and frankly a must-see in Turkey. You can hike along to them too, or go via boat.

                  The boat then cruised along the river and out to the Aegean Sea and we made our way through the shallows and out to a small secluded beach for lunch.
                  Yes, all this and we haven’t even had lunch yet! 
                  After a delicious fresh barbeque there was time f or a swim and to make the return trip and more turtle spotting. We stopped at Iztuzu Beach, a beautiful spot for swimming and a regular spot for passing Loggerhead turtles to be seen, before making our way back up the river.
