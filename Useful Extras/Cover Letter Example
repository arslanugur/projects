Dear Mr. Amatte,

Please accept this letter expressing my interest in the lead oral surgery assistant position. 
I am a highly motivated and progress-focused oral surgery assistant with a long-standing background in this industry. 
With over six years of experience and a track record of initiative and dependability. 
I have devised strategic initiatives that will prove valuable to Belevue Oral, Facial & Implant Surgery

Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my infection control and chairside assisting abilities. 
I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency. 
I also greeted over 30 patients upon arrival at the office and helped prepare for surgeries each month.

In my previous role, I contributed collaboration, critical thinking, and treatment room prep toward team efforts and business improvements. 
I am progressive-minded and in tune with new developments in my field. 
I have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong communication talents. 
I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions in which I coordinate activities to achieve a common goal for the surgery.

Please take a moment to review my attached resume, certifications and credentials. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding my candidacy

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely.
Jane Rodgors
